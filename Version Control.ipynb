      "Version Control for the Ipython notebook\n",
      "=========================================\n",
      "\n",
      "This notebook is a public notebook runs on the Openstack vcloud. When the notebook presents a huge advantage for collaboration and code sharing, it may also requires version management to prevent unwanted deletion and changes on code base. We are goint to use version control, in this case **git**, within notebook rather than terminal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, I am using my github account as the default setting for the server and it is possible to commit changes as desired other users but at the same time it requires some extra steps that increases another layer of complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shall be very straight forward for those who have used git in command line before, since ipython notebook provides the magic shell almost identical to nomal shell. For those who does not familiar, the git tutorial recources online are abundant and this is [one of them](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/) \n",
      "\n",
      "I also provided an example below to show the basic command. However, since it is only meant to commit once, please __do not execute the code below again__.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, sometimes output for version control is not desirable, so before commit, it might be better to `Cell`->`All Output`->`Clear` before commit in case input (i.e. the producing code instead of result) is what we really want."
